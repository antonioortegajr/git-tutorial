# IDX Broker

We are a technology company specializing in real estate data.

We take in over 700 data sets from Multiple Listing Services(so housing data)and normalize these data feeds and turn that into web tools agents and developers can use with their websites.

These data sets are all different and subject to change so normalization is an ongoing challenge.

We are in downtown Eugene and have about 50 employees currently, but are looking to expand.
