My name is Anotnio and I work as the Developer Partner Manager at IDX Broker. I help onboard new partners and integrations that will consume our service.

So I deal with developers all day.

Web devs, mobile apps, CRM platforms anyone that need the data we have.

Git has been useful for me in collaboration with our partners. A WP plugin or Chrome Extension I can look over and even contribute code too with out causing a conflict is all possible because of git.

I also have all my personal projects that I start and rarely finish on GitHub.
